When I do the Regression with $statsmodels.api.OLS$, I find the base model doesn't have the const item. And the $R^2$ of the without-const model is uncentered.<br>
So, I merge a method to export the summary result of OLS with a parameter that set to choose the const.<br>
Use step ols and elastic net model to choose the meaningful variables.<br>
